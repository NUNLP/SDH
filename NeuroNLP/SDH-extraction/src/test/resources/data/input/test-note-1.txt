HISTORY:

     ALTERED MENTAL STATUS, ASSESS FOR HEMORRHAGE -





REPORT     Head CT without contrast using the Routine protocol.



     HISTORY: As provided in header.



     COMPARISON: Head CT performed at an outside hospital earlier the same

     day at 12:00 p.m.



     FINDINGS:



     There is stable appearance of acute left frontotemporoparietal

     subdural hematoma measuring up to 1 cm in maximal thickness over the

     left frontal lobe.  This results in rightward midline shift by 6 mm

     at the level of the septum pellucidum, also stable since prior study.

     Hematoma is noted to extend along the tentorial leaflet and left

     aspect of the falx. There is a small amount of intraventricular blood

     in the fourth ventricle and the occipital horns of both lateral

     ventricles.



     There are several small areas of hemorrhagic contusion with

     surrounding edema in the anteroinferior left temporal lobe.



     There is no evidence of acute territorial infarct.  Although there is

     mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, the ventricular system is

     unremarkable in size without evidence of hydrocephalus or entrapment.





     There is fluid within the sphenoid sinuses and scattered ethmoid air

     cells. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are

     otherwise well aerated.



     There is a right frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma and soft tissue

     swelling.  The calvarium appears intact.  Subcutaneous air is noted

     in the right masticator space anterior to the right masseter and

     temporalis muscles.  No fracture is identified, although the study

     was not performed as a dedicated facial CT.  Irregularity in the

     right sphenoid ala (bone window image 37) does not appear contiguous

     through the cortex and likely represents a nutrient foramen or

     sutural variant.



     IMPRESSION:



     Acute left frontotemporoparietal subdural hematoma measuring up to 1

     cm maximal thickness with resultant rightward 6-mm midline shift,

     stable since prior study.



     Anterior left temporal lobe hemorrhagic contusions also stable since

     prior study.



     Right frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma and soft tissue swelling.



     Subcutaneous air in the right masticator space indicative of soft

     tissue injury.  No definite evidence of bony injury, however if there

     is suspicion of osseous facial injury, dedicated facial CT may be

     obtained as clinically indicated.



     Results discussed with Dr. Who at 4:45 p.m. on 7/7/07.
