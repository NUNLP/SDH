This results in rightward midline shift by 6 mm\n\n     at the level of the septum pellucidum, also stable since prior study.\n\n     Hematoma is noted to extend along the tentorial leaflet and left\n\n     aspect of the falx. There is a small amount of intraventricular blood\n\n     in the fourth ventricle and the occipital horns of both lateral\n\n     ventricles.\n\n\n\n     There are several small areas of hemorrhagic contusion with\n\n     surrounding edema in the anteroinferior left temporal lobe.\n\n\n\n     There is no evidence of acute territorial infarct.  Although there is\n\n     mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, the ventricular system is\n\n     unremarkable in size without evidence of hydrocephalus or entrapment.\n\n\n\n\n\n     There is fluid within the sphenoid sinuses and scattered ethmoid air\n\n     cells. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are\n\n     otherwise well aerated.\n\n\n\n     There is a right frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma and soft tissue\n\n     swelling.  The calvarium appears intact.  Subcutaneous air is noted\n\n     in the right masticator space anterior to the right masseter and\n\n     temporalis muscles.  No fracture is identified, although the study\n\n     was not performed as a dedicated facial CT.  Irregularity in the\n\n     right sphenoid ala (bone window image 37) does not appear contiguous\n\n     through the cortex and likely represents a nutrient foramen or\n\n     sutural variant.\n\n\n\n     IMPRESSION:\n\n\n\n     Acute left frontotemporoparietal subdural hematoma measuring up to 1\n\n     cm maximal thickness with resultant rightward 6-mm midline shift,\n\n     stable since prior study.\n\n\n\n     Anterior left temporal lobe hemorrhagic contusions also stable since\n\n     prior study.\n\n\n\n     Right frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma and soft tissue swelling.\n\n\n\n     Subcutaneous air in the right masticator space indicative of soft\n\n     tissue injury.  No definite evidence of bony injury, however if there\n\n     is suspicion of osseous facial injury, dedicated facial CT may be\n\n     obtained as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n     Results discussed with Dr. Who at 4:45 p.m. on 7/7/07.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDERS:                           SIGNATURES:\n\n     Somebody, Guy MD                   Somebody, Guy MD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[report_end]\n"}}}
